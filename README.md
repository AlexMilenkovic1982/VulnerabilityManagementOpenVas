<h1>Vulnerability Management with OpenVAS in Azure</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
In this lab, I walk you through the process of setting up and utilising OpenVAS, a robust open-source vulnerability scanner, on Microsoft's Azure platform. I guide you step-by-step from creating a deliberately vulnerable Windows 10 virtual machine, to scanning it for security gaps using OpenVAS, and finally to patching those vulnerabilities. This lab gave me invaluable hands-on experience in vulnerability management and a deeper understanding of Azure's cloud services.

## Setting Up an OpenVAS Scanner on Azure

1. **Navigating to the Marketplace**: 
    - Open your browser and head to the Azure portal. Once you're in, go to the Marketplace and search for "OpenVAS secured and supported by HOSSTED".

2. **Choosing a Pre-Set Configuration**: 
    - Pick the option that says "Start with a pre-set configuration" and opt for the least secure one.

3. **Creating the Virtual Machine (VM)**: 
    - Click "Continue to Create VM" and input the following details.
    ![OpenVas Defaults](https://i.imgur.com/UzOSIH9.png)
    - Resource Group: `Vulnerability-Management`
    - VM Name: `OpenVAS`
    - Region and VNet: East US 2
    - Authentication: Username as `azureuser` and password as `Cyberlab123!`
    - Monitoring: Turn off Boot Diagnostic.

4. **SSH into Your New VM**: 
    - After your VM is set up, you can SSH into it using PowerShell if you're on Windows or Terminal if you're on MacOS.

5. **Wait for Deployment**: 
    - You'll see a message that says "Your OpenVAS is deploying, please wait" followed by "hossted stage done".

6. **Access the Web App**: 
    - You should see the web app URL along with the default username and password. Try logging in with those credentials.

## Spinning Up a Vulnerable Windows 10 VM

1. **Creating a New VM**: 
    - Navigate back to [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com) and search for Virtual Machines. Create a new one.

2. **Configuration**: 
    - Use the following details.
    ![RDP into Win10 Vulnerable](https://i.imgur.com/s7PV1S5.png)
    - Resource Group: `Vulnerability-Management`
    - VM Name: `Win10-Vulnerable`
    - Region: East US 2
    - Virtual Network: Match your OpenVAS VM
    - Image: Windows 10 Pro
    - Size: Any with at least 2 vCPUs
    - Username: `azureuser`
    - Password: `Cyberlab123!`

3. **Making the VM Vulnerable**: 
    - Log in and disable the Windows Firewall.

    - Restart the VM.
    

## Configuring OpenVAS for Initial Unauthenticated Scan

1. **Adding a New Host**: 
    - Log into OpenVAS and navigate to `Assets -> Hosts -> New Host`. Add the private IP address of your Windows 10 VM.

2. **Setting up a New Target**: 
    - Create a new target from the host you've just added. Name it "Azure Vulnerable VMs".

3. **Creating a New Task**: 
    - Navigate to `Tasks -> New Task`. Set the name and comments to "Scan - Azure Vulnerable VMs" and select your target.

4. **Starting the Scan**: 
    - Launch the task and wait for it to finish.

5. **Reviewing the Results**: 
    - Once the scan is over, check the date under "Last Report" to review the findings.

## Setting Up Credentialed Scans on the Windows VM

1. **Deactivate Windows Firewall**:

3. **Enable Remote Registry**: 
    ![Win10 VM enable remote registry](https://i.imgur.com/zSa3xFG.png)

4. **Registry Edits**: 
    - Launch the Registry Editor (`regedit.exe`) in admin mode and navigate to `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE -> SOFTWARE -> Microsoft -> Windows -> CurrentVersion -> Policies -> System` and create a new DWORD (32-bit) value: `Name: LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy`, `Value: 1`.

5. **Restart the VM**: Don't forget to reboot to apply the changes.

## Configuring Credentialed Scans in OpenVAS

1. **New Credential**: 
    - Navigate to `Configuration -> Credentials -> New Credential`.

## Remediation Steps

1. **Uninstall the Software**: Log back into your Windows VM and uninstall Adobe Reader, VLC Player, and Firefox.
  
2. **Restart the VM**: Give the machine a quick restart.

## Verifying the Fixes

1. **Run the Credentialed Scan Again**: Head back to OpenVAS and rerun the `Scan - Azure Vulnerable VMs - Credentialed` task. Check the results to confirm that the vulnerabilities have been remedied.
